# Angular

## Modules

1. What is `declarations`? - **things you want to use in templates (components, pipes, etc.)**

1. What is `providers`? - **services. _Note: since Angular 6 you do not need this_**

1. What is the scope of `declarations` and `providers`? - **`declarations` are local, `providers` are global**

1. Why some modules are needed to be imported once, and some many times? - **because of scope difference, see above**

1. Imagine the hierarchical application with modules imported on different levels. How these modules will be placed? (flat or hierarchicaly) - **flat**

  1. And what about lazy loaded modules? - **Lazy loaded modules DO create hierarchy, BUT itâ€™s the hierarchy of injectors, not modules. All imported modules are still merged into one factory during compilation just the same as with non-lazy modules**

1. What to do if you want to create module with services and components? How to import such module? - **`.forRoot()` and `.forChild()`**

1. When writing `.forRoot()` and `.forChild()` static methods are also needed? - **when you want to write a module which is going to imported into both eager and lazy modules**

1. What is `entryComponents`? - **components that are not referenced in template**

1. When you write root module, you should put root component in `bootstrap`. But is it an entry component? - **`bootstrap` array is automatically added in `entryComponents` by compiler**

1. When you write routing, should you put routing components in `entryComponents` array? - **no, routing components are automatically added in `entryComponents` array by compiler**

1. Why `entryComponents` is no longer needed after Angular 9? - **because previously compiler did analyze of application based on NgModule configurations. Ivy does compilation of decorator level. (does it mean that each component in fact is an entryComponent?)**
